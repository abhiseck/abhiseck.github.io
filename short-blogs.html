<h4 id="orgc22772d">Initial work</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc22772d">
<p>
The first patch I've ever sent regarding Emacs was to <a href="https://protesilaos.com">Protesiloas
Stavrou</a>'s (prot) dotemacs repository. I was reading Emacs Lisp manual,
and I was getting bored. I thought it'd be good idea to read some real
life Emacs Lisp code to learn more about how to apply these concepts.
</p>

<p>
Many Emacs extension packages are hosted in proprietary Github. Though I
have Github account I made in 2020, I rarely use it as it's
proprietary. For the same reason I can't contribute to those Emacs
extensions.
</p>

<p>
Prot is one of the best youtubers that cover Emacs right now. Obviously
I watch his videos. From his videos I found out he's written a lot of
cool add-ons for various Emacs extensions. Even though his code is
hosted Gitlab, most importantly he allows Email patches. so I started
reading his code.
</p>

<p>
During the read, I whenever I found some bug or whenever I could think
of any feature, I sent the fix to him. He was kind enough to review
those and accept them if appropriate. I mainly worked on his prot-eww.el
file.
</p>

<p>
I also sent a trivial patch Elpher, which is another cool project that
accepts patches and work with mailing lists.

<h4 id="org43f4b66">Copyright Assignment</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org43f4b66">
<p>
One of the first step for contributing to GNU Emacs or ELPA packages is
to assign copyright to <a href="https://www.fsf.org">FSF</a>. I knew I'll contribute to Emacs sooner or
later so I thought it's good time to complete the paper work beforehand 
instead of waiting.
</p>

<p>
The process is simple but lengthy:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You fill up a form and email it to FSF.</li>
<li>Someone from FSF sends a PDF document by email.</li>
<li>You sign that document, and send it back (if you are employed, you may
a copyright disclaimer from your employer. See the FSF website for
details).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Whole process took nearly 3 weeks to complete.

<h4 id="orgd16069e">Co-authoring patch to GNU Emacs with Prot</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd16069e">
<p>
After that, me and Prot started working on the buffer renaming
feature. Prot had this feature in his prot-eww.el file for long time. It
was very useful especially if you want to use EWW as your primary
browser. You'll need a lot of buffers (same as you open tabs in your big
browser). But the cool thing is, those EWW buffers are easily searchable
using various completion frameworks.
</p>

<p>
Anyways we proceeded slowly as Emacs 28 was just going to be "cut" from
master branch. We were targeting Emacs 29.
</p>

<p>
Then one day we noticed someone requesting the same feature in
bug-emacs, so we talked with the co-maintainers and presented our patch,
and it got accepted!
</p>

<p>
Truly amazing feeling when your patch gets accepted. The feature should
be available in Emacs 29. See Prot's <a href="https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2021-10-15-emacs-29-eww-rename-buffers/">blog post</a> for the details.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully I'll get more opportunity to contribute to Emacs as well as
other GNU packages in the coming days :).

<h3 id="20211023-emacs-guix">[BLOG: 20211023] Errors in Emacs-guix</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-20211023-emacs-guix">
<p>
One of the primary reasons for using <a href="https://guix.gnu.org">GNU Guix System</a> is it provides
fantastic integration with other GNU components and most importantly
with <a href="https://gnu.org/s/emacs">GNU Emacs</a>.
</p>

<p>
There's an Emacs extension called Emacs-guix that can be used from
within Emacs to control the guix cli tool.
</p>

<p>
When I installed guix on a foreign distro (i.e., on <a href="https://parabola.nu">Parabola</a>), I
couldn't use this package, it'd always throw me weird errors. I thought
may be the emacs-guix has a bug.
</p>

<p>
Then when I installed Guix System it still wouldn't work! But today I
found out the solution of the problem. In order to use emacs-guix you
need the following packages:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>guile</li>
<li>emacs-geiser</li>
<li>emacs (obviously)</li>
<li>emacs-guix</li>
<li>emacs-geiser-guile</li>
</ul>

<p>
I had not installed emacs-geiser-guile that's why I was getting those
weird errors. Finally I can enjoy guix from Emacs now!
